# Maths Quiz

## Introduction

This is a simple application that asks the user a series of maths questions and tells the user if they got the question right or wrong. At the end of 10 questions they are given a score and a message based upon how they did.

The code starts off pretty buggy and not very good. There are typos, missing questions, and most of the answers are wrong.

Over the course of several exercises the student will try making the code better, first of all fixing what the original author started and then slowly refactoring it to be a better (and smaller) code base.

Each of the files in this directory are a starting point that takes you closer to the finished app.

## Objectives

1. Get the code in `mathsquiz.py` working.
2. Consider how we might reduce some of the repitition through the use of functions.
3. Consider how we might avoid having to pre-program the questions through the use of random numbers and variables.
4. Consider how we might allow the user to choose which times table they want to focus on by using user input.

## The Files

It's envisaged that the student will take their own path through these problems and tasks. However each of the files in this folder represents a potential check-point between the code in `mathsquiz.py` and `mathsquiz-final`.py
